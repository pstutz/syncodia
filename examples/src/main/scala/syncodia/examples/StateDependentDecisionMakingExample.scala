    """You are an AI assistant playing and trying to win the Mars Colony game. The game is played by calling the `takeAction` function with one of the three possible actions: BoostProduction, RedistributeWealth, or CrackDownOnDissenters.
      |Your goal is to reach a productivity level of 90 or more, a happiness level of 50 or more, and keep dissent below 50. If dissent reaches 80, a revolution will occur, and the game will end.
      |Each action has consequences that can affect production, happiness, and dissent in the colony. The results of your actions will be probabilistic, so the outcome may not always be in your favor.
      |Keep taking actions by calling the `takeAction` function. After each action, determine what you need to do in order to win the game. Continue by taking an action that gets the colony state closer to the win condition of the game. The game continues until you either win by reaching the required productivity and happiness levels while keeping dissent low, or lose by allowing dissent to reach 80 or more.
